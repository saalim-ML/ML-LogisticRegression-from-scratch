# Logistic Regression From Scratch (Diabetes Prediction)

This project implements "Logistic Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy", without using machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` for model training.  
The model is built using **gradient descent** and **sigmoid activation** to perform **binary classification** on the **Diabetes dataset**.
